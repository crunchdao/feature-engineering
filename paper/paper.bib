A typical classroom explanation of the determinationof capital asset prices, for example, usually begins with a carefull and relatively rigorous description of the process through which individuals preferences and phisical relationship to determine an equilibrium pure interest rate. This is generally followed by the assertion that somehow a market risk-premium is also determined, with the prices of asset adjusting accordingly to account for differences of their risk.}}

French},doi={10.1016/0304-405x(93)90023-5},journal={Journal of Financial Economics},abstract={This paper identities five common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds. There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two bond-market factors. related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except for low-grade corporates. the bond-market factors capture the common variation in bond returns. Most important. the five factors seem to explain average returns on stocks and bonds.}}

@ARTICLE{Prado_2019,title={Beyond Econometrics: A Roadmap Towards Financial Machine Learning},year={2019},author={Marcos Lopez de Prado},doi={10.2139/ssrn.3365282},journal={SSRN Electronic Journal},abstract={One of the most exciting recent developments in financial research is the availability of new administrative, private sector and micro-level datasets that did not exist a few years ago. The unstructured nature of many of these observations, along with the complexity of the phenomena they measure, means that many of these datasets are beyond the grasp of econometric analysis. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer the numerical power and functional flexibility needed to identify complex patterns in a high-dimensional space. However, ML is often perceived as a black box, in contrast with the transparency of econometric approaches. This article demonstrates that each analytical step of the econometric process has a homologous step in ML analyses. By clearly stating this correspondence, our goal is to facilitate and reconcile the adoption of ML techniques among econometricians.}}

@ARTICLE{Goerg_2010,title={The Lambert Way to Gaussianize heavy tailed data with the inverse of Tukey's h as a special case},year={2010},author={Georg M. Goerg},journal={arXiv: Statistics Theory},abstract={I present a parametric, bijective transformation to generate heavy tail versions Y of arbitrary RVs X ~ F. The tail behavior of the so-called 'heavy tail Lambert W x F' RV Y depends on a tail parameter delta >= 0: for delta = 0, Y = X, for delta > 0 Y has heavier tails than X. For X being Gaussian, this meta-family of heavy-tailed distributions reduces to Tukey's h distribution. Lambert's W function provides an explicit inverse transformation, which can be estimated by maximum likelihood. This inverse can remove heavy tails from data, and also provide analytical expressions for the cumulative distribution (cdf) and probability density function (pdf). As a special case, these yield explicit formulas for Tukey's h pdf and cdf - to the author's knowledge for the first time in the literature. Simulations and applications to S&P 500 log-returns and solar flares data demonstrate the usefulness of the introduced methodology. The R package "LambertW" (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LambertW) implementing the presented methodology is publicly available at CRAN.}}

Sapsis},doi={10.1137/20m1359833}, journal={SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantification},abstract={Strongly nonlinear flows, which commonly arise in geophysical and engineering turbulence, are characterized by persistent and intermittent energy transfer between various spatial and temporal scales. These systems are difficult to model and analyze due to combination of high dimensionality and uncertainty, and there has been much interest in obtaining reduced models, in the form of stochastic closures, that can replicate their non-Gaussian statistics in many dimensions. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to model stationary chaotic dynamical systems through nonlinear transformations and a set of decoupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Specifically, we use optimal transport to find a transformation from the distribution of time-series data to a multiplicative reference probability measure such as the standard normal distribution. Then we find the set of decoupled SDEs that admit the reference measure as the invariant measure, and also closely match the spectrum of the transformed data. As such, this framework represents the chaotic time series as the evolution of a stochastic system observed through the lens of a nonlinear map. We demonstrate the application of this framework in Lorenz-96 system, a 10-dimensional model of high-Reynolds cavity flow, and reanalysis climate data. These examples show that SDE models generated by this framework can reproduce the non-Gaussian statistics of systems with moderate dimensions (e.g. 10 and more), and predict super-Gaussian tails that are not readily available from little training data. These findings suggest that this class of models provide an efficient hypothesis space for learning strongly nonlinear flows from small amounts of data.}}

The methodology leverages copulas for encoding dependence between two variables, state-of-the-art optimal transport for providing a relevant geometry to the copulas, and clustering for summarizing the main dependence patterns found between the variables. Some of the clusters centers can be used to parameterize a novel dependence coefficient which can target or forget specific dependence patterns. Finally, we illustrate and benchmark the methodology on several datasets. Code and numerical experiments are available online for reproducible research.}}

Lloyd and Seth Lloyd},doi={10.1109/tit.1982.1056489},journal={IEEE Transactions on Information Theory},abstract={It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for 2^{b} quanta, b=1,2, \cdots, 7 , are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.}}
